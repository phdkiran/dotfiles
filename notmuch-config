#		added to all messages incorporated by "notmuch new".
#
#	ignore	A list (separated by ';') of file and directory names
#		that will not be searched for messages by "notmuch new".

# Maildir compatibility configuration
#
# The following option is supported here:
#

#
#		Flag	Tag
#		----	-------
#		D	draft
#		F	flagged
#		P	passed
#		R	replied
#		S	unread (added when 'S' flag is not present)

#	and update tags, while the "notmuch tag" and "notmuch restore"
#	commands will notice tag changes and update flags in filenames
